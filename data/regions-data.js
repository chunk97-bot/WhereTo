The American side offers unique perspectives from observation decks, the Cave of the Winds experience mere feet from Bridal Veil Falls, and the state park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, while boat tours approach the base of Horseshoe Falls for unforgettable up-close encounters. Beyond the falls themselves, the region offers charming wine country, historic sites from the War of 1812, and year-round attractions that make Niagara a bucket-list destination regardless of season.',

The Franz Josef Glacier descends from the Southern Alps almost to sea level, creating extraordinary opportunities to walk on ice or witness this frozen river from helicopter viewpoints. The surrounding region encompasses World Heritage wilderness, hot pools heated by geothermal activity, and the untamed Tasman Sea coastline scattered with driftwood. From soaking in glacier valley hot springs to exploring mirror-calm Lake Matheson reflecting snow-capped peaks, Franz Josef offers intimate encounters with New Zealand\'s most dramatic alpine scenery.',
